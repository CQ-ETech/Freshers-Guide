        Why This Summer Matters
      </h1>
      <p className="text-lg md:text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        From next year onward, you'll be occupied with internships, placements,
        and other responsibilities. You won't get this much uninterrupted free
        time again â€” nearly 45 days of pure potential.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg md:text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        It's hard to master a skill between semesters. These 45 days are perfect
        for deep-diving into a skill, exploring career paths, and gaining real
        clarity.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg md:text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Later, if you're not skilled, you'll feel FOMO. But if you're skilled,
        you'll feel confident. So, why not use this time to boost your
        confidence and future?
      </p>

        This summer isn't just a break â€” it's a launchpad. ðŸš€
